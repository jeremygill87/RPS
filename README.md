# RPS

Purpose:

This program was created to simulate a Rock, Paper, Scissors game between two users - in this case, a human user and a computer.

Motivation: 

This project was created and implemented as a way of developing my skills utilizing JavaScript and jQuery, while also incorporating my love for comic books and all things Marvel.

Licensing:
None.  I can't afford to license Marvel products.  Although, if this is a success, and they want to throw some skrilla my way...
